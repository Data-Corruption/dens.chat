# Working on this codebase

Orientation for coding agents and new contributors. Read this before touching
anything; read the linked docs before touching the things they cover.

## What this is

A per-user Go CLI application that may also run a background worker, a local
HTTPS dashboard, and signed self-updates. Every CLI command (the service
included) is its own process built around one `App`; processes share SQLite in
WAL mode, rotating logs, and a small lock/state protocol in the control
directory. Installers on Linux (`install.sh`, POSIX sh) and Windows
(`install.ps1`) own install, update, and uninstall as transactions.

If `scripts/cut` exists in this tree, this is the upstream Sprout template. If
it doesn't, this is a finalized fork: the project is ordinary Go and shell that
belongs to whoever forked it, and the "Upstream template only" section below
does not apply.

## Documents of record

- `docs/content/docs/architecture.md`: how the processes, database, service,
  dashboard, updates, and releases fit together. Start here.
- `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`: paths, state machine, locks, drain order, detached
  jobs. Read it before changing anything in `internal/maintenance`,
  `internal/layout`, or either installer.
- `docs/content/docs/getting-started/release.md`: publication ordering,
  resume, retention, signing identity.

When a document and the code disagree, the code is right and the document is
stale. Fix the document in the same change.

## Rules that are not obvious from the code

**Fail closed.** Unknown state, unreadable state, a permission that's too
loose, a symlink where a file should be, an installer pair that won't verify:
reject and say why. Never repair silently; a wrong mode is evidence.

**The installer is the only thing that mutates an installation.** The Go
binary admits a verified installer as a detached job and gets out of the way.
Do not add code that replaces the binary, edits the unit or scheduled task, or
runs migrations outside the `--migrate` path the installer authorizes with a
nonce.

**Invoking migration is the point of no return.** Before it, the installer can
roll back. After it, failure keeps the transitional state and the operator
reruns the installer. Do not add code that pretends a downgrade happened.

**Migrations are ordered functions in
`internal/platform/database/migration.go`.** Database steps and the
`user_version` bump commit together. Non-database side effects in a step must
be idempotent because an interrupted step can run again.

**Ordinary processes hold the shared lifecycle lock and publish a PID marker;
installers take the exclusive side.** Every process also watches `state.json`
and cancels its context when the phase leaves `ready` or the version or epoch
changes. Anything that blocks must return promptly on context cancellation.

**Windows has no graceful task stop.** Controllers write an expiring
`service.stop` lease; the service polls it. A controller retires only the lease
it wrote (`ReleaseServiceStopRequest`); start paths clear unconditionally.
`schtasks /End` is the fallback after a timeout, never the first move.

**Sessions have a fixed lifetime.** Cookie `MaxAge` and the database row both
expire 30 minutes after login. There is no sliding renewal on purpose.

**Every process keeps a modest fixed SQLite pool (4).** The Wasm driver gives
each connection its own memory sandbox and SQLite serializes writers anyway.
`go.mod` pins `ncruces/go-sqlite3` to a floor that fixes a Windows WAL
corruption bug; do not lower it.

**Rotating-log failures are sticky only when the file is.** `pkg/xlog/rlog`
disables itself after an I/O error on the log file; a lock-acquisition timeout
or a prune failure returns an error for that write and the next flush retries
with the buffer intact. Keep that split when touching the writer.

**Dependencies must earn their keep.** Standard library first; `golang.org/x/`
is fine. A new third-party module needs to solve a non-trivial problem cleanly
without dragging a tree behind it.

**Test files end in `_test.go`, nothing else.** `cmd/hygiene_test.go` fails on
`*_test_*.go` names and on `testing` reaching the shipped binary. That bug
happened once for real.

**Line endings.** `.gitattributes` forces LF for `*.go` and `*.sh`. Some
PowerShell and a few other files are CRLF; do not "fix" them wholesale.

**Windows code compiles only under `GOOS=windows`.** After touching a
`_windows.go` file, run `GOOS=windows go vet ./...` and
`GOOS=windows go test -c -o /dev/null ./<pkg>` to catch build breaks; the
tests themselves run in CI on a Windows runner.

## Build and test

```sh
./scripts/test.sh              # go test -race ./... with embed placeholders; run constantly
./scripts/test.sh -lint        # pinned shellcheck over the shell scripts; run after touching them
./scripts/build.sh             # dev binary: isolated -dev storage, debug logs, auth bypass, no updates
./scripts/build.sh --prod      # production-mode binary for this architecture
./scripts/build.sh --prod-all  # all release binaries
gofmt -l ./cmd ./internal ./pkg && go vet ./... && GOOS=windows go vet ./...
```

Slower harnesses (Linux only): `./scripts/test.sh -release` runs the
publication state machine against a local rclone backend; `-e2e` runs the
install/update/uninstall lifecycle across distros in Incus containers, with
per-case logs under `out/lifecycle-e2e-logs/<run>/`. See `architecture.md` for
what each covers.

Third-party tools (Tailwind, esbuild, cosign, rclone, shellcheck, goimports,
Hugo) are pinned by version and SHA-256 in `scripts/vendor.sh` and fetched into the
gitignored `tools/`. Never depend on `tools/` contents directly.

Generated and ignored: `internal/ui/assets/{css/output.css,js/output.js,manifest.json}`,
`out/`, `tools/`, `docs/out/`. Edit sources under `internal/ui/assets/css/input.css`
and `internal/ui/assets/js/src/`.

## Where to add things

- CLI command: constructor in `internal/app/commands`, registered in
  `commands.go`. A test scans the AST and fails if you forget to register it.
- Worker: replace the body of `runWorker` in `internal/app/commands/worker.go`.
  If you remove the hash example, `scripts/test-lifecycle-e2e.sh` already has
  `TEST_EXAMPLE_HASH=false` in forks.
- Durable state: a migration step, then accessors beside the owning subsystem.
- Dashboard route: a handler package under `internal/platform/http/router`,
  mounted in `router.go`, with an explicit permission on writes.
- Permission: `internal/types/perms.go`.
- Project values (name, release URL, contact, ports): the block at the top of
  `scripts/build.sh`.

## Style

Explicit errors wrapped with `%w`, `errors.Join` for cleanup, `sync.Once` for
idempotent close, context cancellation as the cooperative stop everywhere
(doesn't need handling *everywhere*, e.g. database txns. Just try not to block
forever). Comments explain why an ordering or check exists, not what the next
line does. Tests use only the standard `testing` package, open real SQLite in
`t.TempDir()`, and spawn real subprocesses for cross-process claims. Keep it
that way.

## Documentation

Write reader-facing docs for a template user learning the current system.
Explain what it does, how to use it, and the constraints that affect the user.
Define unfamiliar terms before relying on them.

Avoid "Doylist" framing: narrating implementation history, a recent refactor,
rejected alternatives, or the conversation that produced a change. These docs
are not a changelog. Describe current behavior directly; put change history
and implementation rationale in commits or PR descriptions. Include rationale
in user docs only when it helps the reader make a decision or understand a
constraint.

## Upstream template only

Skip this section in a finalized fork.

Optional features are source code fenced with ownership markers, not runtime
flags:

```text
// --- BEGIN update.apply ---   ...   // --- END update.apply ---
// --- FILE service.https ---        (whole file)
// --- FILE template ---             (deleted by every finalize)
```

Four comment styles are recognized (`//`, `#`, `<!-- -->`, `/* */`). Owners:
`update`, `update.apply`, `update.apply.auto`, `service`,
`service.https`, plus reserved `template`. Nested fences express "needs both";
whole-feature prerequisites live in `internal/cut/features.go`. Cutting a
prerequisite removes its dependents transitively (`update.apply.auto` also
requires `service`). Both CI matrices use that graph. Markdown is deliberately
not a marker candidate.

- New optional code must live inside the correct fence or `FILE` owner, and
  must leave every one of the 11 cut variants compiling and passing.
  `./scripts/test.sh -cut` runs them all.
- Do not add compatibility shims, legacy decoding, or deprecation paths.
  Upstream never publishes releases; forks freeze their own invariants at
  their first release. Change the initial migration, layouts, and protocols in
  place.
- Two things a fork cannot change after shipping: the artifact layout and the
  cosign signing identity, which is derived from the path
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Never rename or move that file.
- `scratch-pad.md`, when present, is gitignored upstream design rationale.
  Trust the code over it.

## Things `transplant` depends on

These are a versioned contract for the separate setup wizard. If their
semantics change, bump `Contract.Version` in `internal/cut/features.go` and
coordinate the change with Transplant.

- `scripts/cut --list-features-json` prints only JSON on stdout, with
  `version: 1` and a `features` array of `{name, prerequisites}` records derived
  from the cutter's graph. It exits without inspecting or editing the tree.
  Discovery cannot be combined with `--finalize`, `--module`, or feature names.
- `scripts/cut` previews by default, accepts `--finalize`, `--module`, and
  positional feature names, and exits nonzero on failure. Removal expands
  transitively: apply requires update; automatic application requires apply
  and service; HTTPS requires service. The canonical names are `update`,
  `update.apply`, `update.apply.auto`, `service`, and `service.https`.
- `scripts/build.sh` has exactly one `# Project config ---...` section ending
  at the next named section rule. Its exact `NAME="value"` assignments are
  `APP_NAME`, `RELEASE_URL`, `CONTACT_URL`, `DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL`, plus
  `SERVICE_DESC` when service survives and `SERVICE_DEFAULT_PORT` when HTTPS
  survives. The service fallbacks outside that section are not project inputs.
- Markdown-only docs means retaining `docs/content/docs/**` and
  `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`; everything else under `docs/` may be pruned.

Transplant owns the questions and validates this contract before editing; the
checkout's own cutter owns dependency expansion and finalization. Metadata and
all cutter tooling remain template-only and disappear during finalization.
