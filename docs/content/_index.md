<div class="sp-intro">
  Built with <span class="bold-text">love</span> <!-- as much as i'm legally allowed to give --> and unhealthy amounts of caffeine, Sprout handles the stuff that's easy to underestimate: shared state, process lifecycle, authenticated HTTPS, releases, installation, and safe updates.

## Sprout and GoReleaser solve different problems

<div class="sp-comparison">
  <p>
    <a href="https://goreleaser.com/">GoReleaser</a> is mature release
    automation for Go apps that already exist. It builds, packages, signs,
    and publishes across many source hosts, registries, and packaging
    ecosystems. If you already have an app and just need release automation,
    I'd use it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sprout on the other hand is an app starting point and operating model.
    Its release flow is coupled to the app so an update can stop running
    processes, replace the binary, authorize and apply migrations, and restart
    safely. By coupling them and targeting Linux and Windows, you get
    extremely robust direct to user release and operation.
  </p>
  <ul class="sp-comparison__choices">
    <li>
      <strong>Choose GoReleaser</strong> when you already have an application
      and want broad, established release automation, or need out of the
      box macOS support.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Choose Sprout</strong> when you're starting a CLI / daemon and
      want to distribute direct to users on Linux and Windows, with the app,
      service, state, and release pipeline designed together for elevated robustness.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="sp-comparison__note">
    In theory you could <a href="https://youtu.be/31P1dFjiZOc">combine</a>
    them, but that'd mean recreating Sprout's pipeline across many package
    managers, and then you'd have N unique variants to maintain... With just
    Sprout, you have one universal transactional pipeline, only parts of it
    needing both a Windows and Linux implementation.
